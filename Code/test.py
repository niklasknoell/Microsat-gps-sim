## Context
"""
This example demonstrates the basic propagation of a (quasi-massless) body under the influence of a central point-mass attractor. It therefore resembles the classic two-body problem.

Due to the quasi-massless nature of the propagated body, no accelerations have to be modelled on the central body, which is therefore not propagated.
As one expects from this setup, the trajectory of the propagated quasi-massless body describes a Keplerian orbit.

Amongst others, the example showcases the creation of bodies using properties from standard SPICE data `get_default_body_settings()` as well as the element conversion functionalities `keplerian_to_cartesian_elementwise()` of tudat.
It also demonstrates how the results of the propagation can be accessed and processed.
"""

## Import statements
"""
The required import statements are made here, at the very beginning.

Some standard modules are first loaded: `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.

Then, the different modules of `tudatpy` that will be used are imported.
"""

# Load standard modules
import numpy as np

# Load tudatpy modules

## Configuration
"""
NAIF's `SPICE` kernels are first loaded, so that the position of various bodies such as the Earth can be make known to `tudatpy`.

Then, the start and end simulation epochs are setups. In this case, the start epoch is set to `0`, corresponding to the 1st of January 2000.
The end epoch is defined as 1 day later.
The times should be specified in seconds since J2000.
Please refer to the API documentation of the `time_conversion module` [here](https://tudatpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/time_conversion.html) for more information on this.

## Environment setup
"""
Letâ€™s create the environment for our simulation. This setup covers the creation of (celestial) bodies, vehicle(s), and environment interfaces.
"""


### Create the bodies
"""
Bodies can be created by making a list of strings with the bodies that is to be included in the simulation.

The default body settings (such as atmosphere, body shape, rotation model) are taken from `SPICE`.

These settings can be adjusted. Please refere to the [Available Environment Models](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_user_guide/state_propagation/environment_setup/create_models/available.html#available-environment-models) in the user guide for more details.

Finally, the system of bodies is created using the settings. This system of bodies is stored into the variable `bodies`.
"""

# Create default body settings for "Earth"
bodies_to_create = ["Earth"]

# Create default body settings for bodies_to_create, with "Earth"/"J2000" as the global frame origin and orientation

### Create the vehicle
"""
Let's now create the massless satellite for which the orbit around Earth will be propagated.
"""

# Add vehicle object to system of bodies
bodies.create_empty_body("Delfi-C3")


## Propagation setup
"""
Now that the environment is created, the propagation setup is defined.

First, the bodies to be propagated and the central bodies will be defined.
Central bodies are the bodies with respect to which the state of the respective propagated bodies is defined.
"""

# Define bodies that are propagated
bodies_to_propagate = ["Delfi-C3"]

# Define central bodies of propagation
central_bodies = ["Earth"]


### Create the acceleration model
"""
First off, the acceleration settings that act on `Delfi-C3` are to be defined.
In this case, these simply consist in the Earth gravitational effect modelled as a point mass.

The acceleration settings defined are then applied to `Delfi-C3` in a dictionary.

This dictionary is finally input to the propagation setup to create the acceleration models.

    bodies, acceleration_settings, bodies_to_propagate, central_bodies
)


### Define the initial state
"""
The initial state of the vehicle that will be propagated is now defined. 

This initial state always has to be provided as a cartesian state, in the form of a list with the first three elements reprensenting the initial position, and the three remaining elements representing the initial velocity.

In this case, let's make use of the `keplerian_to_cartesian_elementwise()` function that is included in the `element_conversion` module, so that the initial state can be input as Keplerian elements, and then converted in Cartesian elements.

# propagated in this simulation. The initial conditions are given in

### Create the propagator settings
"""
The propagator is finally setup.

First, a termination condition is defined so that the propagation will stop when the end epochs that was defined is reached.

Subsequently, the integrator settings are defined using a RK4 integrator with the fixed step size of 10 seconds.

Then, the translational propagator settings are defined. These are used to simulate the orbit of `Delfi-C3` around Earth.

## Propagate the orbit
"""
The orbit is now ready to be propagated.

This is done by calling the `create_dynamics_simulator()` function of the `numerical_simulation` module.
This function requires the `bodies` and `propagator_settings` that have been defined earlier.

After this, the history of the propagated state over time, containing both the position and velocity history, is extracted.
This history, taking the form of a dictionary, is then converted to an array containing 7 columns:
- Column 0: Time history, in seconds since J2000.
- Columns 1 to 3: Position history, in meters, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.
- Columns 4 to 6: Velocity history, in meters per second, in the frame that was specified in the `body_settings`.

## Post-process the propagation results

The results of the propagation are then processed to a more user-friendly form.
