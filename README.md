# Microsat-gps-sim
Microsat engineering GNSS simulator


Tasks:
- Create trajectory in csv based on TLEs (basically done by Bas)
- recompile gps-sdr-sim for longer runtimes (done locally, need to check on the machine in the lab)
- run the sdr to gnss receiver and record output in NMEA/binary format
- parse NMEA an binary format
- write analysis program to compare trajectory input and gnss receiver output (Bas)
